### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:

  # it should be == in the if statement.
  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
    else
      return False
      # the else statement didnt have a colon:
   
# typo,should be def.
# The if else statement hasn't indent correctly.
# card is not define.
# Theres a space between card1 and card2.
  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    return card
  else:
    return card2
  

# didnt assign anything to total so its not a variable.and the function hasn't indent correctly.
def cards_total(self, cards):
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
  
```
